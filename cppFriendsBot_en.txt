I wonder why the plural form of day-off is days-off and the plural form of plug-in is plug-ins.
Programmers compare lossless compression to freeze-drying coffee, from-concentrate juice, and futon compression bags.
I get plenty of exercises - move, jump, spin, load, carry, and push in my assembly code.
Walt Disney said, "If you can dream it, you can do it.". Contestants of competitive programming may say "If you can come up with it, you can implement it."
In C and C++, you can replace if(p) { free(p); } with free(p); . free(NULL) does nothing and does not crash. This is a kind of the null object design pattern.
If you wonder some C++ empty structs are defined, leave them untouched and do not bundle them into one struct. They are tags for Boost.MultiIndex.
You may find a comment in C++ code that says "This variable must be unsigned". It is a good practice to write an assertion "static_assert(std::is_unsigned)".
It is a pesky bug that an interrupt handler constructs a C++ object which calls malloc unintentionally. Malloc is not reentrant so the handler rarely corrupts heap. This is hard to reproduce.
T is a function to transpose a matrix in NumPy and t is a function to transpose a matrix in R. Stan has the T operator which is used for truncated data models.
Before writing assert_equals, check their arguments. Google Test and CppUnit take (expected, actual). CUnit and R testthat::expect_equal take (actual, expected). It is troublesome to swap expected and actual values after writing unit tests.
The logo of Boost C++ Libraries uses hexagons like benzene rings. It recalls us that the libraries work well together with the C++ standard library. Tidyverse is a collection of R packages and it also uses hexagons in its logo.
x64 uses SSE registers and x86 uses 80-bit x87 FPU registers in floating-point arithmetic. This occasionally leads to different results of the same calculations.
sizeof(4) is accidentally treated as 4 in many platforms. Do you mean "size_t var = 4;"?
C++ compilers are novelists. They have you read their gargantuan error novels when there's something wrong in C++ code using templates.
An interrupt is like pizza delivery. A driver rings the doorbell, you suspend your programming, and you pick up a pizza box on the floor. Bon app√©tit!
Random seeds are required to reproduce results in some algorithms. You should save seeds or you will have a hard time reproducing the results.
In C++, the 'this' pointer is rarely necessary. It is an example to write explicit 'this'. std::bind(&T::MemberFunction, this, std::placeholders::_1)
It is a bad practice that an int holds a distance of two pointers in C/C++. Use ptrdiff_t and describe "%td" in printf().
When you write a unit test, make it fail first. Otherwise, you wonder if the test passes or is empty or does not run.
It is not easy to parse -1-1e-3 to -1.001.
An advantage of just-in-time compilation over ahead-of-time compilation is generating platform-specific code. I have not written code for AVX-512.
std::ofstreams in C++ automatically close file streams that they opened. This is a typical RAII behavior. Note that if closing a file fails in a destructor of std::ofstream, the destructor tells nothing.
