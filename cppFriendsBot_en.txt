Programmers compare lossless compression to freeze-drying coffee, from-concentrate juice, and futon compression bags.
I get plenty of exercises - move, jump, spin, load, carry, and push in my assembly code.
Walt Disney said, "If you can dream it, you can do it.". Contestants of competitive programming may say "If you can come up with it, you can implement it."
In C and C++, you can replace if(p) { free(p); } with free(p); . free(NULL) does nothing and does not crash. This is a kind of the null object design pattern.
If you wonder some C++ empty structs are defined, leave them untouched and do not bundle them into one struct. They are tags for Boost.MultiIndex.
You may find a comment in C++ code that says "This variable must be unsigned". It is a good practice to write an assertion "static_assert(std::is_unsigned)".
It is a pesky bug that an interrupt handler constructs a C++ object which calls malloc unintentionally. Malloc is not reentrant so the handler rarely corrupts heap. This is hard to reproduce.
T is a function to transpose a matrix in NumPy and t is a function to transpose a matrix in R. Stan has the T operator which is used for truncated data models.
